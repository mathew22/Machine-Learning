
SphericalClustering -> randomnly generates the vectors and clusters them into the number of groups specified.
SphericalCLustering3groups/Modfied -> Specifically generate 10 vectors around theta  = 0 , 90 and 180 and clusters them into theree points

 initial labeling is different for the above files 
 sphericalClustering3Groups -> intial label 1,2,3,1,2,3...
 MOdified -> initial label ->1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3...
